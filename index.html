        <h3>Phillips Curve</h3>
        <p>The Phillips Curve is a curve demonstrating the fact that higher rates of inflation are correlated with lower rates of unemployment. The idea is that if unemployment becomes lower, then the employees gain more bargaining power (as the employers must compete harder for employees). This bargaining power results in higher wages, causing inflation.</p>

        <h3>Pareto Principle</h3>
        <p>The Pareto Principle is the idea that approximately 20% of a given X will be responsible for 80% of a given Y. Here we see it applied to wealth in the United States. A small percentage of all people in the United States possess the majority of the wealth.</p>
